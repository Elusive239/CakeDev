**Cake**
===========

The C# based scripting language where you can have your cake and eat it too! (***Dies***)

This was made for fun (in C# .Net 7.0) but maybe I'll put it in a game one day!. Also yes i've been writing this
without git for a good while! Time to put it on git for real and get this finished!

Click [here](SYNTAX.md) to get a hopefully short and easy to understand overview of the syntax. Subject to modification, will likely break as Cake is fleshed out.
